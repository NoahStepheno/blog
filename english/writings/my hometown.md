# My hometown.

I'm afraid I can't wait to introduce how my hometown is to you. I have to talk about how delicious the foods are, especially Northeast style barbecue. I've been exploring different tastes in different shops.

When I was a child, I used to drink Kvass that has a rich, dark brown color and a slightly cloudy appearance, with a thin layer of bubbles on top. It had a unique, slightly sweet and malty smell, and the taste was refreshing and slightly effervescent. It also had a reasonable pice. I would like to drink it again, but I can't.

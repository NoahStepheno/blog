# When I was a student.

I grew up in JiLin city, JiLin province, China, from primary school to high school. I was an introverted boy during that period of time. Most of time I was quiet, I pretended to be a good student, but I wouldn't feel like studying.
I always played tricks to get out of school and then went to play video games that I was good at. It was really a excellent time without thinking about life of real world.

But I really wanna study knowledge about every things when I was above 25. I needed it to improve the quality of life. I needed to get more money through it. I needed it to improve the mental health of mine. But I was not used to study hard, so I was in struggling. It was very difficult for me to get the real knowledge, because, I knew where it was, but i didn't understand them, I didn't have enough knowledge to understand materials in English. So I decided to learn English at that moment, I was gonna be a expert in English, even I'm not sure if I can do it.

I'm looking forward to becoming a new me, and I've been working on it. I'm thinking about taking a IELTS Test to prove I'm already an expert in it. I'm dying to see how my life will run after getting a job of foreign company through english.
